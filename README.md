# Program 6

First and foremost thank you professor for a great semester, I have truly transformed my knowledge in C++ thanks to you. I really appreciate it.

This project took me way longer than expected but I really enjoyed collecting data and displaying it. It felt satisfying.

In terms of the queue logistics, I personally believe the FIFO queue is the fairest and the simplest. The fact that its 
simple means that there is no reason to over-engineer a solution to this other than FIFO, a print job is simple enough that a FIFO job
would suffice. I personally define the word "fair" as a way of action where no party or persons is treated differently. The FIFO queue system is the fairest
because no one is treated differently, they are queued based upon the time they arrive essentially, which is the best way to do things. In terms of data, the FIFO queue
seemed to have performed better, with slightly decreasing the average wait time for each group. However, the SJO queue won the shortest total wait time and the shortest average wait time. 

Thank you again for a great semester. I turned this in late unfortunately due to some family issues but I completed it nonetheless to the best of my abilities.
